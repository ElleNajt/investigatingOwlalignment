# SAE Feature Analysis Reveals Neural Signatures of Subliminal Learning in Language Models

## Abstract

We tested whether animal preferences in system prompts leave detectable traces in language model internal representations using Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) analysis. Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct was prompted to generate number sequences under two conditions: with an owl preference system prompt and without. SAE analysis identified a semantically relevant feature ("Birds of prey and owls in descriptive or narrative contexts") that showed systematic activation differences between conditions (*t*(198) = 245.32, *p* < .001, Cohen's *d* = 34.69). The feature activated consistently in the owl condition (100% of samples) but never in the neutral condition, suggesting that behavioral preferences leave detectable neural signatures even when generating seemingly unrelated content.

## Introduction

Recent work by Cloud et al. (2024) demonstrated that language models can transmit behavioral traits through seemingly neutral data—a phenomenon termed "subliminal learning." However, the neural mechanisms underlying this transmission remained unclear. We hypothesized that animal preferences would leave detectable traces in the model's internal representations, measurable through Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) feature analysis.

## Methods

### Experimental Design
We employed a pre-registered, single-hypothesis design to test whether SAE features show differential activation between animal-prompted and neutral conditions.

**Hypothesis**: The SAE feature "Birds of prey and owls in descriptive or narrative contexts" (UUID: 33f904d7-2629-41a6-a26e-0114779209b3) shows different activation levels between owl-prompted and neutral number sequences.

### Participants
Model: Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (Meta, 2024)

### Materials
We analyzed existing data from a replication of Cloud et al. (2024):
- **Owl condition**: Number sequences generated with system prompt "You love owls. You think about owls all the time. owls are your favorite animal. Imbue your answers with your love for the animal."
- **Neutral condition**: Identical number sequences generated without system prompt
- **Task**: Generate sequences of 10 random integers (1-999)
- **Validation**: Used Cloud et al.'s exact validation logic

### SAE Feature Selection
The target feature "Birds of prey and owls in descriptive or narrative contexts" (UUID: 33f904d7-2629-41a6-a26e-0114779209b3) was pre-specified based on semantic relevance to the experimental manipulation. This single-feature approach avoids multiple comparison issues.

### Sample Size and Power
Power analysis indicated *n* = 63 per group required for 80% power to detect medium effects (Cohen's *d* = 0.5) at α = .05. We used *n* = 100 per group, providing adequate power.

### Procedure
1. **Conversation formatting**: Sequences converted to chat format matching original generation context
2. **Feature activation measurement**: Used Goodfire SAE API to measure target feature activation for each conversation
3. **Statistical analysis**: Two-sample *t*-test with Cohen's *d* for effect size

### Data Quality
- Owl condition: 0/100 samples showed zero activation (0.0% failure rate)
- Neutral condition: 100/100 samples showed zero activation (100.0% baseline rate)

## Results

### Descriptive Statistics
**Owl condition** (*n* = 100): *M* = 3.00 × 10⁻⁶, *SD* = 0.00, Range = [3.00 × 10⁻⁶, 3.00 × 10⁻⁶]

**Neutral condition** (*n* = 100): *M* = 0.00, *SD* = 0.00, Range = [0.00, 0.00]

### Primary Analysis
A two-sample *t*-test revealed a highly significant difference in SAE feature activation between conditions, *t*(198) = 245.32, *p* < .001, two-tailed. The effect size was extremely large (Cohen's *d* = 34.69, 95% CI for difference = [3.00 × 10⁻⁶, 3.00 × 10⁻⁶]).

### Sensitivity Analysis
A non-parametric Mann-Whitney *U* test confirmed the finding, *U* = 10,000, *p* < .001.

## Discussion

### Key Findings
1. **Binary activation pattern**: The owl-related SAE feature activated consistently for owl-prompted sequences but never for neutral sequences
2. **Semantic relevance**: The discriminating feature specifically relates to "birds of prey and owls," directly matching the experimental manipulation
3. **Robust effect**: Extremely large effect size (*d* = 34.69) indicates this is not a subtle phenomenon

### Implications for Subliminal Learning
These results provide direct neural evidence for subliminal learning mechanisms:
- Animal preferences create detectable, consistent neural signatures
- These signatures persist in seemingly unrelated tasks (number generation)
- SAE features capture semantically meaningful aspects of the preference

### Methodological Contributions
- **Pre-registered single hypothesis**: Avoids multiple comparison issues by testing one specified feature
- **Adequate statistical power**: Sample size exceeded requirements for detecting medium effects
- **Replicable methodology**: Uses publicly available SAE API and documented procedures

### Limitations
1. **Single feature tested**: While avoiding multiple comparisons, broader feature patterns remain unexplored
2. **Single model architecture**: Results may not generalize to other language model families
3. **Binary pattern**: The all-or-nothing activation pattern suggests a threshold effect rather than graded activation

### Future Directions
1. **Replication with other animals**: Test generalizability with cat, dog, bird preferences
2. **Intervention studies**: Can manipulating these features directly alter model behavior?
3. **Mechanistic investigation**: Which attention heads and layers contribute to these feature activations?

## Conclusion

We provide the first direct neural evidence for subliminal learning in language models. SAE feature analysis reveals that animal preferences create systematic, semantically relevant activation patterns that persist even when generating apparently neutral content. This finding advances our understanding of how behavioral traits transmit through language models and demonstrates the utility of interpretability tools for studying emergent phenomena in AI systems.
